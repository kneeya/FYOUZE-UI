# FYOUZE Interface

## What is FYOUZE?
FYOUZE is a networking tool in the form of both a web and mobile application that allows people to efficiently expand their social and professional circles and ground their various media platforms. When a user creates a FYOUZE account, they can connect it to their favourite social media apps – Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. – so that all of their channels are conveniently grouped in one place. 

When two users connect on FYOUZE, they can seamlessly add one another on whichever media platforms they choose with just one click; this allows them to more effectively build their network and strengthen their relationships. 

FYOUZE contacts can be categorized into personal and professional connections given the prevalence of business social media accounts today, allowing users to keep their work and social lives separate and preserve their digital identities.
